# Genetic Algorithms Library

This Python Proyect provides an implementation of genetic algorithms for solving optimization problems. Genetic algorithms are heuristic search algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. They are often used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems.

## Features

- **GeneticAlgorithm class**: Provides a flexible framework for implementing genetic algorithms.
- **Customizable**: Easily customizable parameters such as population size, number of iterations, mutation rate, and crossover methods.
- **Support for Graph Problems**: Designed to handle graph-based optimization problems.
- **Well-Structured**: Organized and well-commented code for easy understanding and modification.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for small to large-scale optimization problems.

## Usage

```bash
# Example usage
Npop = 50  # Population size
Nit = 100  # Number of iterations
# Define other parameters and problem-specific data
# ...

# Create a GeneticAlgorithm instance
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(Npop, Nit, ...)
# Run the genetic algorithm
ga.run()
